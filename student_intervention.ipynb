    " - Strength: The parameters for Gaussian NB is small, and it is very easy to setimate them. The model will perform the best when the assumptions are met, like features are independent and are gaussian distributed.\n",
    " - Weakness: The assumptions are oversimplified, there are seldom cases where the conditions are strictly satisfied in real applications. So it it likely performs badly when features are highly correlated or nongaussian distribution.\n",

    " - Weakness: Doesn't give us direct probalistic result, just give the prediction output, and it is not that intuitive easy to extent the algorithm to handle multiple classes. Moreover, for this case former steps didn't require us to do normalization to the numerical cariables, thus it is biased to give some numerical variable more weight. (If we are allowed to modified the code for preprocessing, we can do this step.) For most nonlinear kernel, the result is hard to interpret. \n",

    " - Application: The commercial web search engines Yahoo[12] and Yandex[13] use variants of gradient boosting in their machine-learned ranking engines. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting#Usage\n",
    " - Strength: Ensemble learning methods, because of this, it has the strength of decision tree method like can handle different data types, robust to outliers and missing values. And also this algorithm can predict very well.\n",
    " - Weakness: Prone to overfit, more parameters to tune in order to avoid overfitting. Hard to interpret and takes longer to train the model.\n",

    "### Implementation: Model Performance Metrics\n",
    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",
    " - Use a `random_state` for each model you use, if provided.\n",
    " - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",
    "- Create the different training set sizes to be used to train each model.\n",
    " - *Do not reshuffle and resplit the data! The new training points should be drawn from `X_train` and `y_train`.*\n",
    "- Fit each model with each training set size and make predictions on the test set (9 in total).  \n",
    "**Note:** Three tables are provided after the following code cell which can be used to store your results."

The Gaussian NB method peformed really bad on dataset of size 100, which implies that it is not so robust. Gaussian NB will highly depend on the data provided, also its performance on the training set is really bad. For the Gradient Boosting method, first of all, the training period is really long, almost 10 times of SVM method, also the default setting for the algorithm seems overfit the data, for that the F1-score on train set is nearly one, it may takes a lot of time to tune the parameters to regularize this model. \n",

Our mission is simple, use a line to seperate the two clusters. There are many lines can do this, but there is only one line that lines right in the middle of these two clusters, and the distance between the cluster and the line is maximized. Moreover, only a small portion will play a role in deciding the line, those solid square and circle on the graph, which are called support vectors. Sometimes, it is hard to find a line directly seperate these two clusters, we can do this in higher dimension."

The training score was significantly improved, but the testing score(which we most care about) just got slightly improvement. This may due to that the default setting for the dataset is nearly the best, and the bottleneck of SVM model on this dataset is not mearly the parameters, but also the data itself. Actually, when I did some preprocessing of continous variables(just normalization), the F<sub>1</sub>  would come to 0.8108. \n",

    "Great review, as you mentioned, this classification problem is an unbalanced one, and the result showed that many students who need intervention are actually classified into wrong class, which is not what we want. So, except for create cross validation sets by keeping the percentage of the classes, maybe it is a good idea to use boostrap to enlarge the smaller size class, or use more personalize weights for different class in the loss function."

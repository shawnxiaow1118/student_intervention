    " - Weakness: Doesn't give us direct probalistic result, just give the prediction output, and it is not that intuitive easy to extent the algorithm to handle multiple classes. Moreover, for this case former steps didn't require us to do normalization to the numerical cariables, thus it is biased to give some numerical variable more weight. (If we are allowed to modified the code for preprocessing, we can do this step.)\n",

    " - Strength: Ensemble learning methods, because of this, it has the strength of decision tree method like can handle different data types, robust to outliers and missing values. And also this algorithm can predict very well.\n",
    " - Weakness: Prone to overfit, more parameters to tune in order to avoid overfitting. Hard to interpret and takes longer to train the model.\n",

    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",
    " - Use a `random_state` for each model you use, if provided.\n",
    " - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",
    "- Create the different training set sizes to be used to train each model.\n",
    " - *Do not reshuffle and resplit the data! The new training points should be drawn from `X_train` and `y_train`.*\n",

The Gaussian NB method peformed really bad on dataset of size 100, which implies that it is not so robust. Gaussian NB will highly depend on the data provided, also its performance on the training set is really bad. For the Gradient Boosting method, first of all, the training period is really long, almost 10 times of SVM method, also the default setting for the algorithm seems overfit the data, for that the F1-score on train set is nearly one, it may takes a lot of time to tune the parameters to regularize this model. \n",

And by using the kernel trick, it automatically extends the features space to higher dimension and thus achieves better result. The training part takes the training features and training targets as input, and iteratively learn the parameters for the seperate hyperplane(actually a function). When a new student's data comes, the classifier will take the features as input and output the class label for the student, based on the value calculated from the learned function."
